#Shadruah - My Portfolio

This is the first Zipline among FreeCodeCamp projects that I aim to complete before this semester (Sem1 AY15/16) ends.
My hope is to accomplish the Front-End Web Development Certificate as soon as possible to start volunteering with NPOs.

This project refers to Mr. Thiago Fereira's project (http://codepen.io/ThiagoFerreir4/pen/eNMxEp) for much inspiration and template.
Also, it applies the framework of Bootsrap3 and slider of bxslider which provides a simpler look compared to the former's carousel.
